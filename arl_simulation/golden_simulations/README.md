This is the golden simulation.

Summary:
1.4GHz, full track 45 degree declination, +/- 6 hours
All cases use GRASP beam at current FOV.
Wind heading tracked throughout simulation, using nearest (in az, el) PSD
Reference pointing at 30min
Case 1: Scaling with wind speeds. Wind heading tracked throughout simulation, using nearest (in az, el) PSD. Frequency is L band. 0.3Jy/beam cutoff/ 10s integration
Case 2. Fixed offsets in elevation and cross-elevation. Pointing mis-set due to pointing error. Equivalent to case 1 but with same RMS but errors constant.
Case 3: Snapshot version of case 1
Case 4: Variation with source count cutoff flux
Case 5: Variation with integration time (30/10/3/1)
Case 6: Variation with elevation (i.e. change declination)
case 7: Case 1 with MID_GAUSS
