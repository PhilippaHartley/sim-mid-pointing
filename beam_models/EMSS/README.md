EM analysis is being performed by SARAO, who have provided an initial set of far field patterns in `SKA_B2_965.mat`. A script, `load_emss.py`, loads this MATLAB file which contains voltage patterns for four polarisations: JHH, JVV, JHV and JVH. Each voltage pattern is provided as a theta x phi array, where theta is the angle from the bore sight, with theta = 0 defining the bore sight [deg], and phi is the angle in aperture plane, with 0 = "up from vertex", and defines plane of symmetry [deg]. The script converts each voltage pattern into a rho\*sin phi x rho\*cos phi array.

The raw values of the voltage patterns are saved in fits files each containing all four polarisations, with one fits file each for the real, imaginary, amplitude and phase parts. The patterns are also saved in .png files, which plot the raw values in all cases apart from the case of amplitudes, which are plotted in dB by evaluating 10\*log10(A/A0), where A0 is the value of the maxmimum amplitude and the factor of 10 rather than 20 is chosen to bring out the detail of the lower levels of the pattern.
