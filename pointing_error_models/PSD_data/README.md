PSDs representing precision conditions. The columns are:


* 0: Frequency in Hz
* 1: PSD of position error for the AZ Axis ( servo error) in as^2/Hz
* 2: PSD of position error for the EL Axis (servo error) in as^2/Hz
* 3: PSD of pointing error for the XEL Axis (PXEL) in as^2/Hz
* 4: PSD of pointing error for the EL Axis (PEL) in as^2/Hz

i.e., columns 1 and 2 refer to the trajectory dynamics and columns 3 and 4 refer to wind effects.
