A script to generate a time series of pointing errors from a given power spectrum. Axes EL and AZ refer to errors due to the servo movement in elevation and azimuth, respectively. PXEL and PEL refer to errors due to wind in azimuth and elevation, respectively, where PXEL is the cross elevation in the azimuth direction, corrected for cos(EL).

The power spectra are derived from wind conditions measured for an elevation and azimuth of 45 deg and 135 deg, respectively (the values represent the worst cases for axes separately i.e. do not correspond to the same position of the dish).
